> simple app i did to learn a little bit of Gatsby

Netlify deployed app using a contentful CMS to render blog posts.  Also uses a number of plugins available from Gatsby including the gatsby-plugin-scss and a few image plugins.  Learned about SEO in the process.  Also learned to use GraphQL and how to update graphql to render playground instead of the default interface.
